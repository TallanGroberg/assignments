    <p>LANGLEY, VA_A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of crititcal intelligence information with the black highlighers. </p>
      <br />
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents -- "almost invariably the most crucial passages" -- are marred by an indelible black ink that render the links impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
      <br />
    <p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic, such as: </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>the Cold War</li>
      <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
      <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
